## WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS
### In this project I I'm tasked to prepare storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress. WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL or MariaDB as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

## Project 6 consists of two parts:

### Configure storage subsystem for Web and Database servers based on Linux OS. The focus of this part is to give me a practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

### I will Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server. This part of the project will solidify my skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.

## I will be using RedHat Linux server for this Project

## 1. I will LAUNCH AN EC2 INSTANCE THAT WILL SERVE AS â€œWEB SERVER
